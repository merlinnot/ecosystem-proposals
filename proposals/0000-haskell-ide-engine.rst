Focus on Haskell IDE Engine
==============

Haskell IDE Engine is a great initiative which seems to be abandoned.
In the age of Cloud IDEs, plugin-based editors and overall focus
on making developer's life easier perfect autocompletion, linting,
dead code detection etc. seems to be necessary to make language
useful for every-day work.

Motivation
----------

Haskell is a great language for variety of use cases, but an entry
threshold is extremely high. Not only the language itself is
much different than the others, which is actually it greatest strength,
but forcing people to use emacs with multiple plugins and limited
number of tools is too much for most of the people. Correct me if I'm
wrong, but only usable dev env for Haskell is using emacs/spacemacs
with Intero (I've tried lots of them), which limits me to use Stack.

Haskell is years behind others in this matter. Take a look at
`Swift Playground
<http://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/>`_,
`IntelliSense
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense>`_,
`Go Guru
<https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/guru>`_. Isn't it
beatiful what others make for us?

Last commit to this repository was made on Sep 23, there's actually
not much but planned features list. 

Proposed Change
---------------

We should all focus on making Haskell IDE Engine work, maybe find
some funding, commit our own time to hack around, ask our friends and
coworkers to join the project.

All details are available `here
<https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine>`_.

Drawbacks
---------

- bugs in this tool would affect majority of IDEs

Alternatives
------------

I can see no reasonable alternatives.
